# riches.nvim

We got ourselves a RAGs to riches kind of scenario here. Gather and manage context for your neovim session, and then send it to some LLM - i don't care who.

We gotta make ourselves rich shipping so fast.

## Installation

You should just know by know.

## Usage

who knows.

## Thoughts

Two-phase LLM shenanigans.

1. do what we're doing so far
2. LLM responds with file paths that are relevant.
3. read those files, send as new message
4. ask for a diff to update the files
